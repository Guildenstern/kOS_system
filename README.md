# kOS_system
my collection of kOS scripts. kOS is a mod for Kerbal Space Programm. See http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/

I put the libs from https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib to my script root dir. and added them to .gitignore, too. Maybe I should check them in, too. Please mail me if you think so, too.
